    <p>As part of the CroCoNet approach, pairwise module preservation scores are calculated between replicates, both within and across species (see <code><a href="calculatePresStats.html">calculatePresStats</a></code>) and neighbor-joining trees are reconstructed based on these preservation scores per module (see <code><a href="convertPresToDist.html">convertPresToDist</a></code> and <code><a href="reconstructTrees.html">reconstructTrees</a></code>). The tips of the resulting tree represent the replicates and the branch lengths represent the dissimilarity of module connectivity patterns between the networks of 2 replicates.</p>
<p>Various useful statistics can be defined based on these trees (see also <code><a href="calculateTreeStats.html">calculateTreeStats</a></code>). The total tree length is the sum of all branch lengths in the tree and it measures module variability both within and across species. The diversity of a species is the sum of the branches connecting the replicates of this species and it measures module variability within this particular species. The within-species diversity is the sum of the diversity values across all species and it measures module variability within species in general. The subtree length of a species is defined as the sum of the branch lengths in the subtree that is defined by the replicates of the species and includes the internal branch connecting these replicates to the rest of the tree, and it measures module variability within this species as well as between this species and all others.</p>
<p>Overall divergence is best represented by the total tree length, while species-specific divergence is best represented by the subtree length of a species, however the absolute values of these statistics in themselves are difficult to interpret. The diversity (either overall or for a particular species) can be used as an internal reference to determine whether the total tree length or the subtree length of a species is larger/smaller than expected. The general relationship between total tree length and overall diversity or between the subtree length and the diversity of the species is captured via linear regression (see also <code><a href="fitTreeStatsLm.html">fitTreeStatsLm</a></code>). In term of cross-species conservation, the most interesting modules are then the outliers that do not follow the linear trend.</p>
<p>By analyzing the linear regression between total tree length and within-species diversity, we can single out modules that are conserved or diverged overall. The modules that fall far below the trend line are the most conserved ones: they have a lower total tree length than expected based on their within-species diversity, meaning that the species are not well-separated within the tree but rather mixed among each other. In contrast, the modules that are located far above the trend line are the most diverged ones: they have a higher total tree length than expected based on their within-species diversity, meaning that they thave long cross-species branches between one or more pairs of species.</p>
<p>By analyzing the linear regression between the subtree length and the diversity of a species, we can single out modules that are diverged between this particular species and all others: these are the modules that fall far above the trend line, i.e. that have a longer branch leading to this species than expected based on the diversity of the species. The modules that fall below the trend line are in this case not meaningful, since we can only call a module conserved, if it is conserved across all species.</p>
<p>For both types of analysis, we quantitatively define which modules are outliers, and thus conserved or diverged, by calculating the prediction interval of the linear fit. A module is considered diverged overall/in a species-specific manner if it has a higher total tree length/subtree length of a species than the upper boundary of the prediction interval, while a module is considered conserved if it has a lower total tree length than the lower boundary of the prediction interval.</p>
<p>The degree of conservation/divergence can be further compared between the modules categorized as conserved/diverged. We recommend 2 measures: 1) the residual, which is the difference between the observed and expected total tree length/subtree length of a species, and 2) the t-score, which is the residual normalized by the standard error of the total tree length/species subtree length prediction.</p>
<p>The linear regression can be weighted by the error of the data points. To gain this information, we can use jackknifing: each member gene of a module is removed and all statistics are recalculated (see the parameter <code>jackknife</code> in the function <code><a href="calculatePresStats.html">calculatePresStats</a></code>). The weight of a module in the regression is then defined to be inversely proportional to the variance of the dependent variable (total tree length/subtree length of a species) across all jackknife versions.</p>
