\description{
Tree-based statistics per random module. The trees were reconstructed based on module preservation scores (cor.kIM) within and across species. The tips of resulting tree represent the clones and the branch lengths represent the dissimilarity of connectivity patterns between the clones. The total tree length is the sum of all branch lengths in the tree and it measures module variability both within and across species, while the within-species_diversity is the sum of the human, gorilla and cynomolgus within-species branch lengths and it measures module variability within species only.
These statistics were calculated for all possible jackknifed versions of the modules, each of which was created by removing a target gene assigned to the given module (the regulators were never excluded). Then the statistics were summarized per module by taking the median and its 95\% confidence interval across all jackknifed module versions.
