\description{
Correlation of intramodular connectivities (cor_kIM) per clone pair and module. The preservation statistic cor.kIM quantifies how well the connectivity patterns are preserved between the networks of two clones, mathematically it is the correlation of the intramodular connectivities per module member gene in the network of the 1st clone VS the intramodular connectivities per module member gene in the network of the 2nd clone.
This statistic was calculated for all possible jackknifed versions of the modules, each of which was created by removing a target gene assigned to the given module (the regulators were never excluded). Each jackknifed module was compared between all posible pairs of clones, both within and across species, resulting in a cor.kIM value per jackknifed module version and clone pair. Finally, the cor.kIM values were summarized per module and clone pair by taking the median and its 95\% confidence interval across all jackknifed module versions.
