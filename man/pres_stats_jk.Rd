\format{
A data frame with 8352 rows and 8 columns:
\describe{
\item{regulator}{Character, transcriptional regulator.}
\item{module_size}{Integer, the numer of target genes assigned to a regulator.}
\item{type}{Character, module type (orig = original or jk = jackknifed).}
\item{id}{Character, the unique ID of the module version (format: nameOfRegulator_jk_nameOfGeneRemoved in case of module type 'jk' and nameOfRegulator_orig in case of module type 'orig').}
\item{gene_removed}{Character, the name of the gene removed by jackknifing (NA in case of module type 'orig').}
\item{clone1, clone2}{Character the names of the clones compared.}

\description{
Correlation of intramodular connectivities (cor_kIM) per clone pair for the original and all jackknifed versions of the pruned modules. The jackknifed versions of the modules were created by removing each target gene assigned to a module (the regulators were never excluded). The preservation statistic cor.kIM was then calculated for the original module as well as each jackknife module version by comparing each clone to all others, both within and across species. cor.kIM quantifies how well the connectivity patterns are preserved between the networks of two clones, mathematically it is the correlation of the intramodular connectivities per module member gene in the network of the 1st clone VS the intramodular connectivities per module member gene in the network of the 2nd clone.
