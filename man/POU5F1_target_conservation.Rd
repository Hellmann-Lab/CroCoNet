\item{type}{Character, module type (orig = original, jk = jackknifed or summary = the summary across all jackknife module versions).}
\item{id}{Character, the unique ID of the module version (format: nameOfRegulator_jk_nameOfGeneRemoved in case of module type 'jk', nameOfRegulator_orig in case of module type 'orig' and nameOfRegulator_summary in case of module type 'summary').}

Cross-species conservation measures of the 21 target genes in the POU5F1 module in the subsetted early neuronal differentiation dataset.

\details{
To determine which target genes are the most responsible for the divergence of the POU5F1 module, the same statistics were be used as for the identification of conserved/diverged modules but in combination with jackknifing. This means that each target gene in the module was removed and all statistics, including the tree-based statistics that carry information about cross-species conservation, were re-calculated (please see \code{\link{calculatePresStats}}, \code{\link{reconstructTrees}} and \code{\link{calculateTreeStats}}). Our working hypothesis is that if removing a target gene from the diverged POU5F1 module makes the module more conserved, then this gene contributed to the divergence of the original module in the first place. This can be quantified using the residuals compared to the regression line between the total tree lengths and within-species diversities of the tree representations across all modules (please see \code{\link{fitTreeStatsLm}} and \code{\link{findConservedDivergedTargets}}. The jackknifed versions of the POU5F1 module that have the lowest residuals are the most conserved, therefore the corresponding target genes are considered the most diverged.
