\arguments{
\item{module_names}{Character or character vector, the name(s) of the module(s) of interest.}

\item{pruned_modules}{Data frame of the pruned modules, required columns:
\describe{
\item{regulator}{Character, transcriptional regulator.}
\item{target}{Character, target gene of the transcriptional regulator (member of the regulator's pruned module).}
}}

\item{consensus_network}{\code{\link{igraph}} object, the consensus network across all species and clones.}

\item{network_list}{A list of \code{\link{igraph}} objects containing the networks per clone.}

\item{clone2species}{A data frame that specifies which clone belongs to which species, required columns:
\describe{
\item{clone}{Character, name of the clone.}
\item{species}{Character, name of the species.}
}}

\item{N}{Integer, the number of edges to plot (default: 200).}

\item{n_cores}{Integer, the number of cores (default: 1).}

\item{layout}{Character, graph layout (default: "kk", other reasonable options are "auto", "stress", "star", "circle", "nicely", "dh", "gem", "graphopt", "grid", "mds", "fr", "drl", "eigen", "fabric", "linear" and "unrooted"). See also \code{\link{ggraph}}, \code{\link{layout_tbl_graph_stress}} and \code{\link{layout_tbl_graph_igraph}}.}

\item{seed}{Integer, the seed for setting up the graph layout (default: 0, only relevant for certain layouts such as "gem", "nicely", "dh", "graphopt", "fr" and "drl").}

\item{colors}{Character vector, the colors to visualize the edge divergences. The vector can contain any number of colors that will be passed on to and converted into a continuous scale by \code{scale_color_gradientn}.}

\item{font_size}{Numeric, font size (default: 14).}

\item{edge_width}{Numeric vector of length 2, the range of edge widths for plotting the graph edges (default: c(0.2, 1.2)).}

\item{ncol}{Integer, the number of columns the subplots should be organized into if several modules are input. If NULL (default), the dimensions of the grid will follow the default of \code{\link{wrap_plots}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{ggraph}} object in case the argument \code{module_names} is a single module name and a \code{\link{patchwork}} object in case the argument \code{module_names} is a vector of module names.

\description{
In the CroCoNet approach, networks are reconstructed per clone and combined into a single phylogeny-aware consensus network which is the basis of the module assignment.

This function selects the intramodular edges of the input module(s) in the consensus network, orders them by the consensus edge weight and keeps the top \code{N} edges per module for plotting. This means that only those module member genes will appear on the plot that are involved in the top \code{N} connections, the regulator itself might also be omitted if it is not particularly well-connected.

The edges that were kept are plotted using \code{\link{ggraph}} per module. The default layout is "gem", other reasonable options include "stress", "circle", "nicely", "dh", "graphopt", "mds", "fr", "kk" and "drl" (see also \code{\link{ggraph}}, \code{\link{layout_tbl_graph_stress}} and \code{\link{layout_tbl_graph_igraph}}). The width of the edges represents the consensus edge weights, the range of widths can be set using \code{edge_width}.

For each edge, an edge divergence score is calculated based on its edge weights in the networks of individual clones. The edge weights are compared across species using an ANOVA and the F-statistic (i.e. the variation between the species means / variation within the species) is regarded as the measure of edge divergence and used to color the edges on the plot.

If the aim is to plot the networks of several modules together, the input \code{module_names} should be a vector of module names. The \code{\link{ggraph}} plots are in this case combined together into a single \code{\link{patchwork}} object with the titles of the subplots matching the elements of \code{module_names}. All subplots have the same scale so that the edge weights and divergence scores are comparable across modules.

\details{
Plots the top \code{N} strongest connections of the chosen module(s) based on the consensus network. The edge width indicates the consensus edge weights, while the edge color indicates the degree of edge divergence across species.
