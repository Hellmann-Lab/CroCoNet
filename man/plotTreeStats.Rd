\usage{
plotTreeStats(
  tree_stats,
  random_tree_stats = NULL,
  stats = c("within_species_diversity", "total_tree_length"),
  colors = NULL,
  font_size = 14,
  point_size = 0.05,
  point_alpha = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_stats}{Data frame of the tree statistics for the actual (pruned) modules. Required columns:
\describe{
\item{regulator}{Character, transcriptional regulator.}
\item{module_size}{Integer, the numer of target genes assigned to a regulator (only needed if the data points are desired to be colored by module size).}
\item{\{\{nameOfStat\}\}}{Numeric, 2 columns containing the tree statistics to be plotted against each other.}
}}

\item{random_tree_stats}{Data frame of the tree statistics for the random modules (optional). If provided, the following columns are required:
\describe{
\item{regulator}{Character, transcriptional regulator.}
\item{\{\{nameOfStat\}\}}{Numeric, 2 columns containing the tree statistics to be plotted against each other.}
}}

\item{stats}{Character vector of length 2, the names of the columns containing the 2 statistics that should be plotted against each other (default: c("within_species_diversity", "total_tree_length"), another useful option is to plot the species-to-other branch length against the diversity for a chosen species). The 1st element of the vector will be plotted on the x-axis and the 2nd element of the vector will be plotted on the y-axis.}

\item{colors}{Character vector, either the colors to visualize the module sizes (if only \code{tree_stats} is provided), or the colors to visualize the actual and random modules (if both \code{tree_stats} and \code{random_tree_stats} are provided). In the first case, the vector can contain any number of colors that will be passed on to and converted into a continuous scale by \code{scale_color_gradientn}. In the second case, the vector should contain 2 colors for the actual and random modules.}

\item{font_size}{Numeric, font size (default: 14).}

\item{point_size}{Numeric, the size of the points (default: 0.3).}

\item{point_alpha}{Numeric, the opacity of the points (default: 1).}
}
\value{
A scatterplot as a \code{\link{ggplot}} object showing a chosen tree-based statistic (e.g. total tree length) against another (e.g. within-species diversity) for all pruned modules and if provided, all random modules.

\description{
Plots a chosen tree-based statistic (e.g. total tree length) against another (e.g. within-species diversity) for all pruned modules and if provided, all random modules.

\details{
As part of the CroCoNet approach, pairwise module preservation scores are calculated between clones, both within and across species (see \code{\link{calculatePresStats}}) and neighbor-joining trees are reconstructed based on these preservation scores per module (see \code{\link{convertPresToDist}} and \code{\link{reconstructTrees}}). The tips of the resulting tree represent the clones and the branch lengths represent the dissimilarity of module topology between the networks of 2 clones.  Various statistics can be defined based on these trees such as total tree length, total within-species diversity, diversity of a species and species-to-other branch length (see \code{\link{calculateTreeStats}}).

These tree-based statistics can be used to pinpoint conserved and diverged modules. First, a linear regression model is fit between the total tree length and within-species diversity (in case the focus of interest is conservation and overall divergence) or between the species-to-other branch length and the diversity of a species (in case the focus of interest is the species-specific divergence), and then outlier data points are identified that do not follow the general linear trend (see \code{\link{fitTreeStatsLm}} and \code{\link{findConservedDivergedModules}}).

This function visualizes the relationship of 2 tree-based statistics. This can be an informative check for the pairs of statistics that are used to measure cross-species conservation - total-tree length VS within-species diversity (default) or species-to-other branch length VS the diversity of a species - before fitting a linear regression model between them.

If \code{random_tree_stats} is provided, the actual and the random modules are plotted together, shown in 2 different colors. Most tree-based statistics (especially the ones measuring diversity) are expected to be lower for the actual modules than for the random modules, therefore the 2 sets of modules are expected to cluster separately on the plot with the actual modules located towards the lower values.

If \code{random_tree_stats} is not provided, only the actual modules in \code{tree_stats} are shown on the plot. In this case, if the column "module_size" is present in \code{tree_stats}, the data points are colored by module size.
