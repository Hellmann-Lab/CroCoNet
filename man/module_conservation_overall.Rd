\title{Cross-species conservation measures per module}
\format{
A data frame with 12 rows and 16 columns:
\describe{
\item{focus}{Character, the focus of interest in terms of cross-species conservation ("overall").}
\item{regulator}{Character, transcriptional regulator.}
\item{module_size}{Integer, the numer of target genes assigned to a regulator.}
\item{total_tree_length}{Numeric, total tree length per module (the median across all jackknife versions of the module).}
\item{lwr_total_tree_length}{Numeric, the lower bound of the confidence interval of the total tree length calculated based on the jackknifed versions of the module.}
\item{upr_total_tree_length}{Numeric, the upper bound of the confidence interval of the total tree length calculated based on the jackknifed versions of the module.}
\item{within_species_diversity}{Numeric, within-species diveristy per module (the median across all jackknife versions of the module).}
\item{lwr_within_species_diversity}{Numeric, the lower bound of the confidence interval of the within-species diversity calculated based on the jackknifed versions of the module.}
\item{upr_within_species_diversity}{Numeric, the upper bound of the confidence interval of the within-species diversity calculated based on the jackknifed versions of the module.}
\item{fit}{Numeric, the fitted total tree length at the within-species diversity value of the module.}
\item{lwr_fit}{Numeric, the lower bound of the prediction interval of the fit.}
\item{upr_fit}{Numeric, the upper bound of the prediction interval of the fit.}
\item{residual}{Numeric, the residual of the module in the linear model. It is calculated as the difference between the observed and expected (fitted) total tree lengths.}
\item{weight}{Numeric, the weight of the module in the linear regression, inversely proportional to the variance of total tree lengths.}
\item{t_score}{Numeric, the t-score of the module. It is calculated as the residual normalized by the standard error of the total tree length prediction at the given within-species diversity value.}
\item{conservation}{Character, "not_significant" if the module falls inside the prediction interval of the fit, "diverged" if a module has a higher total tree length than the upper boundary of the prediction interval, and "conserved" if a module has a lower total tree length than the lower boundary of the prediction interval.}

\description{
Cross-species conservation measures of the 12 modules in the subsetted early neuronal differentiation dataset. Modules that were found to be conserved or diverged overall (across all species) are labelled as "conserved" or "diverged" in the column \code{conservation}.
}
\details{
To determine whether a module as whole is conserved or diverged overall, module trees were reconstructed from pairwise preservation scores between clones and based on these trees 2 useful statistics were calculated for each module: the total tree length and the within-species diversity (for details please see \code{\link{calculatePresStats}}, \code{\link{reconstructTrees}}, \code{\link{calculateTreeStats}}). After fitting a weighted linear model between the total tree length and within-species diversity values of all modules, a module was considered diverged if it fell above the prediction interval of the regression line, while a module was considered conserved if it fell below the prediction interval of the regression line (for details please see \code{\link{fitTreeStatsLm}} and \code{\link{findConservedDivergedModules}}. The degree of conservation/divergence can be further compared between the modules categorized as conserved/diverged using 2 measures, the residual and the t-score.
