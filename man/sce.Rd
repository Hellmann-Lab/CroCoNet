\title{SCE object of the primate neural differentiation dataset}
\format{
An SCE object with 300 rows, 900 columns, 9 metadata columns and 2 assays.

Metadata columns:
\describe{
\item{species}{Name of the species.}
\item{clone}{Name of the clone/cell line.}
\item{day}{The day when the cell was collected.}
\item{n_UMIs}{Number of UMIs detected.}
\item{n_genes}{Number of genes detected.}
\item{perc_mito}{Percent of mitochondrial reads.}
\item{sizeFactor}{Size factor for scaling normalization, calculated first per clone using [scran::computeSumFactors] and [scran::quickCluster], then adjusted by [batchelor::multiBatchNorm] to remove systematic differences in covergae across clones.}
\item{cell_type}{Cell type labels predicted by [SingleR::classifySingleR] using the embryoid body dataset from Rhodes et al. 2022 as reference.}
\item{pseudotime}{Pseudotime inferred by [SCORPIUS::infer_trajectory].}
}
Assays:
\describe{
\item{counts}{Raw counts.}
\item{logcounts}{Log-normalized counts created by first calculating size factors per clone using [scran::computeSumFactors] and [scran::quickCluster], then adjusted them to remove systematic differences in covergae across clones and log-normalizing by [batchelor::multiBatchNorm].}

\description{
A subset of the primate neural differentiation scRNA-seq dataset in an SCE format. The data was collected during the early neural differentiation of human, gorilla and cynomolgus macaque iPS cells with 3 human, 2 gorilla and 4 cynomolgus cell lines (clones). Using a directed differentiation protocol, cells were differentiated into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) over the course of 9 days, and scRNA-seq data was obtained at six time points (days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) during this process. The SCE object contains the raw and log-normalized counts as well as the metadata for 300 genes and 900 cells (100 cells per clone).
